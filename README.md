# Digit Recognition
This repo uses the `tensorflow` provided dataset `MNIST`.
The model is trained using `Python` and utilized in `Javascript` using the library `tensorflowjs`.

Two **deep learning models** were trained, "Convolutional Neural Network" and a "Regular Fully-connected Neural Network".
The `CNN` was primarily used for better accuracy. 

# What it does
The application is able to predict which *digit number* (from 0 to 9) the user has drawn on the canvas. This is achieved by machine learning algorithms and `javascript` implementations.
